# DockerWorkshop
A great workshop :D!

In this workshop we will learn how to build images and deploy Docker containers.

For this we will check how to create DockerFiles and how they work. 

We hope that you like it and love Docker as much as we do :).

If you need some guidance or want to learn a bit further, feel free to contact us via Slack @DanielNempeque and @AnaRey
